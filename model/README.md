>Deep & Cross Network (DCN) keeps the benefits of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions.

>Implement with customed estimator which is high-level tensorflow API. It is easy for distributed training and can export saved model for tensorflow serving to predict online.
